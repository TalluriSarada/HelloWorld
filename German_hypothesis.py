#In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains unproven)
#which can be described in the following way:
#take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it c0
#if it's even, evaluate a new c0 as c0 Ã· 2;
#otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new c0 as 3 Ã— c0 + 1;
#if c0 â‰  1, skip to point 2
